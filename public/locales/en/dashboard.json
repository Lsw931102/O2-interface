  "borrowPowerToolTipsThird": "For example, 1 ETH is equal to 4300 USDT, the maximum mortgage rate of USDT is 130%, and the maximum mortgage rate of ETH is 140%. Then, the borrowing capacity that ZS can have after depositing 1000 USDT and 2 ETH is 6912.08 USDT (1000/1.3 + 2*4300/1.4), which means that ZS can lend 6912.08 USDT equivalent of other assets from the Flux agreement.",
  "maximumLTVToolTips": "The maximum mortgage rate is a parameter value that is set according to the risk level of the asset. Represents the maximum loan capacity when a specific asset is used as collateral.
